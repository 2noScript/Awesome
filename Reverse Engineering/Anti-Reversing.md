# Anti-Reverse Engineering

## Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
- [llvm.org](https://llvm.org/)
- [YANSOllvm](https://github.com/emc2314/YANSOllvm) - Yet Another Not So Obfuscated LLVM 

## Memory
- [DeepSleep]()

## x86 / 32-bit
- [x86 Code Virtualizer (Code Obfuscator)](https://github.com/NIKJOO/x86-Code-Virtualizer) - Protect and obfuscate sensitive area of code using virtual machine protection ( translation of byte-code to PCode and run them inside Virtual Machine ) Project has been writen in Microsoft VC++ & little pure asm code and uses BeaEngine as disassembler engine. It's not enough secure to use in commercial projects so try to learn how it works and make it better.

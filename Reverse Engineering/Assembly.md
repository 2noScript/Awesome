# Assembly notes

- Machine/processor language equals patterns of ones and zeros (low-level language): `10110000 01100001`.
  - A binary consits of ones and zeros. A binary can be viewed in hex view programs, where the binary is expressed in hex-format/hexadeciaml.
- "Assembly language" translates machine language into processor instructions, where the above represents the instructions `mov  al, 0x61`
- To assemble means to translates assembly language into machine code. It is done with an `assembler`.
- To disassemble means to translate machine code into assembly language. It is done with a `disassembler`
- Each machine architecture has its own machine language, and it's own assembly language

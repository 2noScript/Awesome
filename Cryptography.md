# Cryptography

- [DEScrypto](https://github.com/DedSecInside/DEScrypto) - DES Encrypter/Decrypter.
- [End-to-end](https://github.com/google/end-to-end) - End-To-End is a crypto library to encrypt, decrypt, digital sign, and verify signed messages (implementing OpenPGP).
- [Hotp-js - A JavaScript HOTP implementation](https://github.com/adulau/hotp-js) - A simple Javascript HOTP implementation (HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) as described in RFC 4226. The library relies on crypto-js (http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) for the javascript HMAC-SHA1 implementation.

## Digital Signatures
- [SignTool](https://www.linux.org/docs/man1/signtool.html) - Digitally sign objects and files.

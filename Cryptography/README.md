# Cryptography

- [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey) - Automatically decrypt encryptions without knowing the key or cipher, decode encodings, and crack hashes
- [CSCI-462](https://github.com/sarah-dill/CSCI-462) - Contains scripts from the class CSCI-462 Introduction to Cryptography 
- [Crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto) - The Crypto interface represents basic cryptography features available in the current context. It allows access to a cryptographically strong random number generator and to cryptographic primitives.
- [Cryptofuzz](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz) - Fuzzing cryptographic libraries. Magic bug printer go brrrr. 
- [CryptoHack.org](https://cryptohack.org/) - A fun free platform for learning modern cryptography.
- [Dcipher](https://github.com/k4m4/dcipher) - Decipher hashes using online rainbow & lookup table attack services.
- [DEScrypto](https://github.com/DedSecInside/DEScrypto) - DES Encrypter/Decrypter.

- [GEA1_break](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/GEA1_break) - Implementation of the key recovery attack against GEA-1 keys (Eurocrypt 2021).
- [GnuPGP](https://gnupg.org/) - The GNU Privacy Guard. GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).

# Deep Learning
_"Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised." - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)_

Commands
````
tar -xvf Whonix-*.xz
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_external*.xml
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_internal*.xml
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-External
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-External
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-autostart Whonix-Internal
sudo virsh -c qemu:///system net-start Whonix-Internal
````
- Access over vnc: edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` and restart libvirtd
- KVM image failed to start with virsh, permission denied
````
User = "root"
group = "root"
vnc_listen = "0.0.0.0"
virt-viewer vnc://localhost:5901
````
- Routing another VM through Whonix on Virtualbox: First remove the default nic. Then add the internal whonix-nic to the VM. Then give the VM network settings which may look like:
````
iface eth0 inet static
  address 10.152.152.11
  netmask 255.255.192.0
  gateway 10.152.152.10
  nameservers 10.152.152.10 #cant rememver if this was correct syntax
